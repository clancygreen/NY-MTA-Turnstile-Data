*Almost all turnstiles report at four-hour cycles throughout the dataset.
*At Wall St-45, all of the turnstiles report hourly, and they are the only turnstiles to do so regularly, so they are treated differently in the code.
*There are two other turnstiles that had small stretches of reporting hourly, but they didnâ€™t seem to be reporting anything useful.
*They are: Hunts Point Ave, R146 R412 00-02-00 and Smith-9 St, R270 N536 00-02-00 (same turnstile no. -- not a mistake)

**THIS SECTION CLEANS AND DIFFERENCES THE DATA



*This process is designed for capturing four-hour time blocks.
*If daily totals are desired, possible approaches include: 
*differencing from the last scheduled reporting time of the day to the same time the previous day
*differencing at the four-hour level, as below, then summing the differences if all six daily four-hour blocks are accounted for
*The first method is probably best, so one missed report doesn't necessarily remove the whole day from consideration for a given turnstile.

*Keep only those observations that occur on the hour
keep if mod(statatime, 3600000) == 0

*Create and sort by a heirarchy of transaction codes (for time duplicates)
*This is based on the frequency with which these codes appear in the data as well as our limited knowledge of the meaning of the codes.
*There are other codes, such as DOOR OPEN, DOOR CLOSE, and LOGON, that are less frequent and used for maintenance.
*Only the most frequent seven are listed here.

*Note: After eliminating duplicates using the steps below, the percentages are 96.3, 0.3, and 0.3 for the first three and the same for the others.
*This suggests that most of the RECOVR AUD and RECOVR transactions occur in tandem with REGULAR transactions, while the other transactions typically do not.

*Drop observations with negative first-difference values:

*Check for outliers / false readings that haven't been deleted
*After spot-checking a few stations, including Times Square, 6000 seems to be a good number.
*6000 per four hours = 25 / min. (at one SCP, which may be more than one turnstile)
*Alternatively, multiples of Interquartile Ranges or Median Absolute Deviation for each station (and perhaps weekday / weekend) could be used,
*but this data has a lot of variation and spikes, for example due to holidays, so cutting too agressively across the board is risky.
*It may be better to leave in all observations that aren't clearly false and then use medians in the analysis. That's what this method does.

	
*Another possible approach is to find the false readings by the activity around them. There are sometimes instances of the entries and/or exits count jumping 
*around, with large, obviously false, movements in both directions of the entries_master and exits_master counts. It seems that this might be primarily when
*maintenance is performed on a turnstile. It might be possible before any observations are dropped (including the observations between hours) to identify the
*pairs or small groups of the entries_master and exits_master movements. The movements are often equivalent in size but opposite in sign, or may be close in size
*but not exact. Such a cleaning method would have to create differences early solely for this purpose, then evaluate the fluctuations, for example, by looking for 
*a negative difference and a partnering positive difference within about 10% of the value of the negative difference.

*Both instances of 1:00 AM are captured by this method. 
*Note that this method assumes that the higher of the readings (by entries_master first, then exits_master) is the later one.
*It may be possible to avoid this assumption by flagging the order of the 1:00 instances as they exist in the raw data files, 
*before any re-sorting or stacking of the data is done.
*If analysis is performed using early morning times, the user should be careful about the extra instances of 1:00 AM.
*If needed, a standardized time variable, such as GMT, could be created based on the given times, 
*DST status (being careful of early morning switches), and the assumption about the 1:00 AM observations mentioned above.


*Difference the entries and exits. These will become the key variables in the dataset.
gen diff_entries = entries[_n] - entries[_n-1] if identifier[_n] == identifier[_n-1] //& one_hr_int == 1
gen diff_exits = exits[_n] - exits[_n-1] if identifier[_n] == identifier[_n-1] //& one_hr_int == 1

label variable diff_entries "Entries"
label variable diff_exits "Exits"

*Drop variables that are no longer needed
drop dst_begin dst_end dst_switch after_switch before_switch one_hr_int

*Remove those records without a first-differenced value, for example, the first observation for each turnstile
drop if diff_entries == .

*Drop observations with negative first-difference values:
drop if diff_entries < 0 
drop if diff_exits < 0

*Check for outliers / false readings that haven't been deleted
*The cut-off value is based on looking at the dataset (see the notes below) and the cut-off value for the four-hour blocks, 6000.
*(6000 / 4 = 1500)
drop if diff_entries > 1500		//	Readings go up to 786, then jump up to one clearly false reading of 1.8 million
drop if diff_exits > 1500		//	Readings go up to 1195, then jump up to 3364 in the same record as the diff_entries of 1.8 million


*Save the cleaned and prepared dataset and erase the intermediary file Wall_St-45
save "$subway_raw/Wall_St_45_prepared.dta", replace

erase "$subway_raw/Wall_St_45.dta"
